# CS231n: Convolusional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition (Spring 2017)
I've been taking CS231n in Summer 2018 to better understand Deep Learning and Computer Vision.
This repository include my solutions for the course's 3 assignments.
Each assignment was completed after watching relevant lectures.
